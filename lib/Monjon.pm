Monjon - create your Moo objects as blessed scalar refs

=head1 SYNOPSIS

		has id   => (is => 'ro', pack => 'L');
		has name => (is => 'rw', pack => 'Z32');
	}
	
	my $obj = MyClass->new(id => 42, name => "The Answer");

Monjon is a subclass of L<Moo> designed for efficient memory usage when
you need to deal with many thousands of very simple objects.

Attributes are stored using a variation on the C<pack>/C<unpack>
technique used by L<BrowserUK|http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=171588>
on PerlMonks at L<http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=1040313>.

However, inside-out attributes are also offered for data which cannot
be reasonably serialized to a string. (However, if you do need to store
things like references, perhaps Monjon is not for you.)

=head2 Differences from Moo

=over

=item C<has>

The attribute spec accepts an additional option C<pack>. The presence
of this key in the specification makes your attribute be stored in the
object's packed string. Attributes without a C<pack> option will be
stored inside-out.

=item C<extends>

Extending non-Monjon classes is not supported. (But who knows? It could
work!)

=item C<before>, C<after>, and C<around>

Monjon is sometimes forced to rebuild constructors and accessors at
run-time, which may lead to method modifiers being overwritten, if you
have tried to apply any modifiers to them.

Basically, don't apply method modifiers to accessors.

=back

=head2 Benchmarking

Monjon's accessors are significantly slower than Moo's, especially when
Moo is able to make use of L<Class::XSAccessor>.

However, if your data consists of mostly numbers, booleans, and small
or fixed-width strings, Monjon is likely to consume a lot less memory
per instance.

L<https://github.com/tobyink/p5-monjon/blob/master/devel.bench/bench.pl>.

=head2 What's a Monjon?

It's a very shy little wallaby, and it's near-threatened. See
L<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monjon>.
